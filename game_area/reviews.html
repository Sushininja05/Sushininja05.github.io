    <h1>RATING: ★★★★★</h1>
    <p>This game has inspired practically everyting I do in terms of development.<br>
    It's single-handedly responsible for Wario Destroys America along with my brand of humor.<br>
    I can only hope to capture the qualities of this gem and it consistently impresses me to this day.<br>
	<br>One of my favorites.</p>

    <h1>RATING: ★★★★★</h1>
    <p>Short but sweet platformer where you descend a fucked up structure.<br>
    Seems dumb at first, but going down is extremely enjoyable and replayable.<br>
    Not very condusive to speed-running despite having bunny-hopping n' stuff.<br>
    Still, very much worth the little time it takes and you'll walk away wanting more.<br>
    <br>
    Has some multi-player elements which make it a lot of fun to play.<br>
    I've played it with a few friends once or twice and it's great.<br>

    <h1>RATING: ★★★★☆</h1>
    <p>A Super Mario World-esque platformer that pays homage to a ton of games.
    Suffers from some particularly annoying bosses and bad levels, but on the whole it's a solid platformer.
    Very funny cutscenes and fulfilling 100% which makes you want to complete it.<br>
    <br>
	Genuinely one of the few times I've had a game had me go:<br>
	"No way I'm 100%'ing this, it's too hard.", then ended up coming back and beating it.<br>
    Really good music too. Well worth your time.</p>

    <h1>RATING: ★★★☆☆</h1>
    <p>Genuinely a fun point n' click + bullet hell game. Bosses are a huge highlight.<br>
    Keeps short and to the point if you know where to go, puzzles are confusing though.<br>
    Bosses are super fun and engaging, Clammy Pottel and Bean Weird are the best imo.<br>
	<br>
    Pretty good 1-2 hour experience, worth a couple plays to see all it has to offer.<br>
	Made by Dany Burton, probably his best game so-far, keep an eye out for the sequel.</p>

    <h1>RATING: ★★☆☆☆</h1>
    <p>A classic freeware platformer with tons of content, a really funny story, and just good platforming.<br>
	<br>
    It's about 3-4 hours long on your first run, there's some jank but it's to be expected.<br>
    If you're not very well acclimated to the jank of old 3d game-maker games, I'd suggest playing the enhanced version.<br>

    <h1>RATING: ★☆☆☆☆</h1>
    <p>A pretty "meh" platformer with some skin-deep puzzle elements but really good story.<br>
	<br>
    It's about 12 hours long on your first run.<br>
	A lot of that is due to the huge amount of fetch quests and padded out hub-world.<br>
	<br>
	Plagued by:<br>
	-Very very slow movement<br>
	-Mainly one-dimensional puzzles<br>
	-Slow and encumbersome menus and pixl system<br>
	-Poor RPG progession stapled on<br>
	-Extraordinarily easy bosses<br>
	<br>
    <br>
    Instead just watch someone play it, it has a lot of charm but playing will wear that charm out thin.</p>

    <h1>RATING: ★★★☆☆</h1>
    <p>I've actually waited quite a long time for this game to come out, in the ball park of 4-5 years.<br>
	Not only that, but it kind of inadvertedly inspired some things in games like Gamit or WDA.<br>
	Honestly, because of that, I never really thought it'd come out nor did I think I'd actually like it.<br>
	<br>
	But it's fun enough really, it's standard RPGMaker affair in terms of what was accomplished.<br>
	It falls into all the traps of an RPG of course, back-tracking, level-grinding, boring areas.<br>
	Bad pacing, etc etc... really I could go on...<br>
	<br>
	But it kind of holds a special place for the time period it was originally supposed to come out in.<br>
	Also because the art, soundtrack, story, and everything else besides the gameplay is really good.<br>
	Do I particularly care? Not really..? But I don't dislike it either.<br>
	<br>
	The routes and endings feel like cop-outs and I'm sure others have already ripped into it.<br>
	For other reasons, probably not just the gameplay.<br>
	<br>
	I do think it is worth the play though so I won't say it's outright bad, it's just very very niche.<br>
	Alternatively, just watch ManlyBadAssHero's playthrough, probably the best one.<br>
	It's linked.</p>
