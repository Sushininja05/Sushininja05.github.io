<TD><DIV CLASS="TITLE">THIS IS THE GAME NAME</DIV><b>Version N/A | 3D Platformer | ???</b>
<BR>Short but sweet platformer where you descend a fucked up structure.<br>
Seems dumb at first, but going down is extremely enjoyable and replayable.<br>
Not very condusive to speed-running despite having bunny-hopping n' stuff.<br>
Still, very much worth the little time it takes and you'll walk away wanting more.<br>
<br>
Has some multi-player elements which make it a lot of fun to play.<br>
I've played it with a few friends once or twice and it's great.<BR><BR>
<a href="#">N/A, DL lost. Will upload a back-up. (? MB)</a></TD>

<TD><DIV CLASS="TITLE">League of Piss</DIV><b>Version N/A | Bullet Hell | Dec 18, 2017</b>
<BR>Very fun point n' click + bullet hell game. Bosses are a huge highlight.<br>
Keeps short and to the point if you know where to go, can be confusing at times though.<br>
Bosses are super fun and engaging, Clammy Pottel and Bean Weird are the best imo.<BR><BR>

<TD><DIV CLASS="TITLE">At Least There is Čeda Čedović</DIV><b>Version v1.04(?) | 2D Platformer | Aug 5, 2020</b>
<BR>A Super Mario World-esque platformer that pays homage to a ton of games.<br>
Suffers from some particularly annoying bosses and bad levels, but on the whole it's a solid platformer.<br>
Very funny cutscenes and fulfilling 100% which makes you want to complete it.<br>
Really good music too.<BR><BR>

<TD><DIV CLASS="TITLE">9 10 doh nightmare</DIV><b>Version N/A | 3D Adventure | ???</b>
<BR>An amazing platformer with tons of content, a really funny story, and just good platforming.<BR><br>
It's about 3-4 hours long on your first run,<br>
there's some jank but it's to be expected.<BR>
If you're not very well acclimated to the jank of old games,<br>
I'd suggest playing the enhanced version.<BR><BR>
