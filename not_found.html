    <p><strong>YOU'VE 404'd LIKE AN IDIOT!</strong></p>
    <p>Now a few things could've gone wrong:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>-You are trying to find special pages and opted to just type out what you think the page would be in the top like a loser.</li>
      <li>-You don't exactly enjoy people's sites so your goal is to try to 404 it and see if it has a 404 or not. Wow loser.</li>
      <li>-You've found a page that isn't completed yet and is currently in progress, check back in a week or two and you'll see the final page.</li>
      <li>-Theres an issue with my site! AAAAAAH! Send a message to me on discord @Durdge-o#4285 so I can fix it up.</li>
      <li>-You've selected a game on the main page that isn't done yet, check back later when the game is released.</li>
