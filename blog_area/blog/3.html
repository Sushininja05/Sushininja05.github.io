              <td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" style="padding:5px"><span class="text4">I've been working on a radio feature which is supposed to be a more robust version of an old idea. 
              Basically a souped up version of the external Radio app I would have along the side of my games.<br />
                <br /> 
                When developing this there were 5 goals in mind:
                <ul>
                <li>-Mute Function</li>
                <li>-Good Menu</li>
                <li>-Fix Overlapping Song Bug</li>
                <li>-Make Song Selection More Intuitive</li>
                <li>-Autoplay Random Songs</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                From those goals we have only met 4 of them, why you ask? I'll explain.<br />
                Cutting, it is a nightmare for me as it means I have to stray from my vision and abandon my goal.<br />
                <br />
                Other people are used to it y'know? Cutting things from their projects because it wasn't working or there were issues is just common practice for others.
                But I make a thing of it to try to avoid straying from my original goals, because I pride myself on my my outlandish ideas and odd design to create fun expierences.
                After all; my latest project, Sockman, and Many Mans Against You is nothing but odd ideas working together despite their difficulties to create fun expierences.<br />
                <br />
                But this time, I've cut a feature that would turn this Radio from good to great.<br />
                Autoplay... It is insanely useful and a flagship feature in things like Spotify and even Youtube Playlists.
                And for me, someone who has conquered loads of developement hurdles can't fucking beat this is beyond stupid.
                <br />
                I'm dissapointed yeah, but in reality this is just to keep me from delaying this game and allow me to release before the end of summer.<br />
                <br />
                Thats it, I just wanted to log some frustrations I've been having with my game and hopefully give some insight into my project which has taken pretty much all summer.<br />
                Release date: sometime next week?</span>
