				This little blog entry was inspired by both my vacation, and a reading on a Gemini Gemlog site, weirdly enough.

			    I'm not sure if anyone can just plop those links in or not so before this entry falls off the deep end I'll leave you with that.<br>

			  So recently, VERY recently, I went on a proper vacation for the first time. 
			  Obviously I'm too poor to actually go on vacation myself, I probably wouldn't even think of it if I had the money to. 
			  In general, I don't really go places, leave the house much, yadda yadda, it's not a mystery as to why either. I mean, have you seen my site?<br>
			  <br>
			  So, for one reason or another, I won't go into specifics since it's too personal, I was invited out of my humble little apartment.
			  It's located in the middle of the desert with no resources, groceries cost like 3x what they do everywhere else, and life is only sustainable due to air conditioning. 
			  I've lived my whole life under AC housing, it's what I know, I've got all the tricks to keep yourself cool in this 120 degree weather down. 
			  So, imagine my surprise when I'm given a plane ticket straight out of my hometown and told I'm going to hang out.<br>
			  <br>
			  I've been out of here a couple times, for very short amounts of time, to very small podunk places or "fake rich" places. 
			  I wasn't very excited or interested, but I figured I'd go along with it so I could get some time outside the house to fight off the endless voices. 
			  That sounds VERY edgy, but I'm not gonna beat around the bush and say I'm in the greatest head space being cooped up in my little 4x4 that I leave to go grocery shopping or to head to the gym, among other obligations. 
			  I got out there and just couldn't process it, like I walked onto another planet. The greenery, rushing of waves, clear skies and blue air. No, I didn't mix those adjectives up.
			  There was something so intensely pure about the world there, as if I was forgiven for whatever sin I had committed in whatever past life I led, no longer walking amongst the damned. 
			  Picturesque, beautiful, glorious. In fact, it's made me reconsider a lot of things. See, most of my art is built around the idea that true beauty doesn't actually exist in the world. 
			  I've seen every Hayao Miyazaki film I can get my hands on, I've indulged in many a picture of natural beauty, I've dug and dug for any escapist dream world I could find. 
			  I thought these places didn't exist. I mean, sure, you can see these photos and hear these stories but was anyone actually there? 
			  Sometimes you get so hung up in the fact you're trapped in your own bubble, your own 4x4, your own corner of the internet, mind, what-have-you... that you completely give up that there's anything out there. 
			  I couldn't GO to these places, they aren't REAL-- I told myself. Now I had just walked into it, dazed, confused, like I wasn't meant to see it.<br>
			  <br>
			  It completely shook me, a lot of things suddenly made sense. I always questioned why people insist on putting terrible things out into the world, why some people are so negative, et cetera.
			  Why would you make horrible "grungey" art of a doomed world or some cosmic horror? What good does that accomplish? Do people want to see that? Really? I doubt it. These people are PUT on EARTH to make us UNHAPPY. 
			  Right? Right?? I mean I'm sure I sound ridiculous but I can only assume the most disgusting torture porn realities are created by the happiest most beautiful unchallenged people, while the exceptions rarely rise to the top. 
			  That isn't to say there's no suffering in the happier plots, worlds, things that focus on the nicer things. Hell, that isn't to say those things don't exist either, I've spent most of my life looking at those things.
			  But now, both the happy and unhappy creations made sense all at once and the wide varities of genres I saw as lesser now had a place, albeit not one I understand, just one I accept. 
			  Ever since 2020, when it really got bad, I've been obsessed with the idea of this better reality. Confused and bewildered as to why anyone wouldn't want their media to be beautiful, glimmering, wonderful. 
			  This greener grass on the other side, if you will. Something so beautiful it'd make me forget my shitty life and location. Even if people could just dumb it down to green grass and blue skies, it wouldn't matter if it meant there was more beauty. 
			  So I took out my depression in many ways, made friend groups, tore down others, lashed out, worked on myself, every single thing you could do. My creations ever since 2018 have shifted towards that goal, that idea, that I could touch a cloud.
			  Just reach out and feel something, partake in that sweet conversation. In fact, I didn't even know I was depressed until lately, it's been a rough couple of months.<br>
			  <br>
			  I felt this feeling very briefly before in 2018, like I said, which is why I added a "fake rich" to the second paragraph. 
			  That time, everything was just out of reach, I didn't consider it a vacation since I had plenty of errands to run and work to do during it. 
			  It was hardly a vacation for the person who invited me out there as well, who shortly after landed in a world of shit and needed until THIS YEAR to recoup. 
			  That's a lot, a lot-a lot. I know I didn't cause it, but it had given me the idea that there was no rest, no respite. No light at the end of the tunnel, even the outside world was just window dressing. 
			  Past the picture frame was just a little diorama, even the faintest belief there was something beautiful and greater was stomped out, like they'd do anything to take it from you.
			  Clearly, I couldn't see the forest through the trees, but now I can. There's a whole world and I'm stuck in a small small little box, instead of thinking that small little box was the best it could ever be. 
			  This mental torment and self-induced torture was just an illusion and now I needed to have it out with GOD, I needed to show that fucker WHAT FOR and free myself from the searing cage. 
			  Now I have a PRIME GOAL, one OVERWHELMING DIRECTIVE, one UNIVERSAL TRUTH to guide me. Like the heavens came down and gifted me pure enlightenment.<br>
			  <br>
			  To say I'm not proud of how I acted before is a bit of an understatement, but I'm not going to say I regret any of it. I found my own way, my own solution, and now I needed to take myself back.
			  First, I shifted directions, I was planning to enlist in the military just to have something to do, but now I have a real goal. I'm pursuing higher education now and I'm GOING to make it work, even if it kills me. 
			  Secondly, I tore out the distractions, the people wearing me down, I don't need the mental anguish of my every day interactions. I needed to get away from these little battles, to stop walking in the rain. So I did.
			  Finally, although this was already somewhat underway, my creations will lean even more into my current hopes of showing people a pretty world, something beautiful and peaceful, hopefully inspiring others to see more of it for themselves. 
			  That feeling of the sand on your feet and the symphony of natural sounds dispels all of your worries. I want to share it, inspire others to do it. I kind of was doing it before but now it's my number one priority, my current project has always had that in mind, but now it'll fucking radiate it. 
			  Is it funny to say something this dramatic on my little dinky website about my game about a sun-man? Yes, but this idea is grandiose and inspiring to me in a way. This little game could show people my little world of beautiful locales. It's all already underway, so it doesn't matter.<br>
