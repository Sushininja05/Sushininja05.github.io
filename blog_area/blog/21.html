                Another pre-emptive warning here, but this also has nothing to do with Grandman progress. 
				I'm diligently chipping away at it, I'll have a blog entry up probably by the end of the year for it. 
				For now, this is probably just the format. Expect more somewhat personal-kinda-not-really stuff.

			  Lemme ask you a question.<br>
			  Rhetorical, of course, but I want you to mull it over in your head. 
			  Just chew on this one for a couple weeks, months, years even.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>What does it mean to be productive?</h3><br>
			  This one's easy, right?<br>
			  Productive people get stuff done! They accomplish things! They achieve things that other people don't! 
			  There's an air to productive people, they have plans, ideas, goals, they aren't *lazy*. 
			  Are you lazy? Do you consider yourself lazy? I'd wager that EVERYONE considers themselves lazy in some way. 
			  Do *you* get things done on a daily basis? Do you bother doing the dishes when there's only a couple in the sink? 
			  A year or so ago I was having a conversation with my friends, I was complaining that I had to do the dishes by hand every night.<br>
			  <br>
			  Do you do the dishes by hand? Do you also manually dry them? Do you scrub them down, meticulously, centimeter by centimeter, to make them clean? 
			  How many dishes do you think you do every night, assuming you do them by hand, ten? Twelve? In the ballpark of one to five? 
			  I'm going to let you in on a no-so-secret secret, but I've never been good at cleaning, but I do all of it. 
			  By some happenstance I ended up being the neat freak, well not exactly a neat freak but I like to keep things clean, not spotless mind you but CLEAN. 
			  I do the dishes every night for my family, I would guess it's about 9-12 pieces of silverware a night, along with 1-2 bowls, 3-4 plates, and 3-4 cups. 
			  Factor in the occasional pot, strainer, cooking utensil, what-have-you... I definitely have a lot to do. 
			  This process, the process of cleaning, takes me about 1-2 hours each night. Just the dishes alone, nothing else.<br>
			  <br>
			  To cut that tangent short, my friends went "yeah bro I just do dishes all the time lol not that hard", so I clapped back. 
			  "How many fuckin dishes do you do? You do em' by hand? shut up retard", I'm pretty proud of that response in all honesty. 
			  For a bunch of guys shooting the shit, that's a Grade-A way to hold your ground, I need ANSWERS and NOW.<br>
			  "What you don't have a dishwasher?"<br>
			  Fuck you say? Speak again?<br>
			  <br>
			  I'm keeping my language a bit cleaner than usual, since it's going up on my site. 
			  Clearly I didn't respond that nicely, nor did I ask my questions as nicely, nor did they. 
			  This also doesn't bother me, we were just hanging and playing shitty videogames, it doesn't matter what they said to be honest. 
			  But at that moment it put into context the amount of work people do, at least compared to me.<br>
			  <br>
			  Do you walk to school every day? Do you spend hours on your dishes? Do you sleep on the floor? Do you have money for food? 
			  I do a LOT more than they do, I like to think I'm incredibly productive. How can I not think so? I do a lot more than the people I know! 
			  I get caught up in these matter-of-fact observations a lot, I think if it weren't for me going "I HAVE FREE WILL! WHERE ARE THEY, HUH?" I would probably be a lot worse off.
			  These people just have it EASIER than me, thus, I am LESS productive. I gotta fight the little battles constantly, so I can't fight the bigger ones as easily.<br>
			  <br>
			  So, to wrap all of this up in a nice little bow, it's astonishing to me that I do get as much as I do done. 
			  It's like I wasn't meant to, of course I'm slow but I clearly have more to show for it. 
			  Maybe, just maybe, I'm doing it all wrong. The body just isn't meant to process all that work, right? 
			  It isn't meant to constantly be going and going. It's like I've forgotten what it means to take a break.<br>
			  <br>
			  Clearly the irony of the situation isn't lost on me, I'm toiling away on little games instead of y'kno the more important things. 
			  I think my priorities are all out of wack, I definitely don't think like most people do, that's for sure. 
			  But I manage, I get by, I take things a little at a time.<br>
			  <h3>Ironically enough, I don't think a "productive" state exits.</h3>
			  I definitely chase the high, I mean, who wouldn't? To feel like you're accomplishing things? 
			  There's no better feeling on earth than completing a big project, it's gotta be more fulfilling than a good meal or sex. 
			  Even then, maybe some people are just wired differently, and I got the bad cables. Who knows?<br>
			  <br>
			  What I do know, is that it's been fucking liberating as of late to finally unwind. 
			  I unwind somewhat, but not really, it's half-hearted. After that, albeit small, vacation, I've been entirely at ease. 
			  There's a light at the end of the tunnel now, something to aim for, and I remember why I made my shitpost game to begin with. 
			  In fact, I've found a lot of purpose in things that normally don't hold any again. Games are fun, development is fun, art is fun, writing is fun, it's weird. 
			  Have you ever just had things turn around like this, entirely in viewpoint? Because my situation hasn't changed a bit, weirdly enough.<br>
			  <br>
			  In fact, to finally get to what the related image for this article is, I'm working on stuff again! 
			  I mean, I always work on stuff, but my pace isn't as terrible now. I say that every time, but it's gone from maybe one very very small thing per day to a handful of hours of real honest work. 
			  It's nice, spring breeze kind of nice. Clear skies, burning bright with the color of the sea type of nice. That sort of gentle echoing from battering rain, sort of nice. 
			  The type of stuff that oozes a good, pleasant, wonderful day... and a little bit of night. To finally climb the mountain again, I feel a bit more like myself again. 
			  Now?<br>
			  <br>
			  I'm working on Wario Destorys America, I know it's a dumb shitpost with little weight. But it's pretty important to me. 
			  For one, it has a lot of soul in it, if you will. There's a lot of old referential humor to what I or my friends thought was funny at the time. 
			  It has a lot of voices from people I just don't talk to anymore in it, I'm not going to remove them either. I don't think that's right. 
			  It's a perfect little time capsule, it's even inspired by similar time-capsule-like creations, like Thingio. 
			  I told myself, unlike Thingio, I would complete it. There would be a third and final act, something to cap off the story with a bang. 
			  It wasn't a hard game to make, right? Well, it was when I had no drive, no motivation. Still licking the wounds of friendships gone awry and being completely aimless.
			  Now? Better than ever, I'm stoked, I want to work on this. I don't think the games are complete without all being one package though, so I've been going over it.
			  Obviously, there's going to be a lot of whiplash from the first two games to the third, but that's okay! What's important is that I get it out, I close this chapter, and move onto my peaceful life after all this.<br>
			  <br>
			  Finishing that little shitpost would close a door, but open a warehouse of doors.<br>
			  There will be twinkling bells and beautiful scenery after all is said and done.<br>
			  As always... take it easy.<br>
