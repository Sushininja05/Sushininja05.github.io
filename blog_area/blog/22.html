			  I've been playing a lot of fighting games recently. 
			  College picked up and the workload is so-so, nothing particularly stands out as harder than one other thing. 
			  I think I've got it all in the bag, I've come to enjoy my new routine.<br>
			  <br>
			  It's been really really refreshing to play some games in a vacuum again, which is weird. 
			  Things are far better with friends, obviously, but games and other creative efforts took a back seat when I had a more active social life. 
			  I'm not that great at balancing things, so I let a lot of things get away from me, I was definitely handling things differently at least. 
			  There's a sense of true clarity at the moment, I'm starting the next chapter of my life and only taking what I need with me. 
			  Enjoying games like TF2 again on it's own merits, not getting dragged into "game of the week" multiplayer games, and spending my time playing games I actually want to play. 
			  Enjoying market gardening, going for sick combos in the fighters I play, just enjoying the small marks of progress. 
			  It's weird that I don't need anything extravagant to feel comforted right now, extremely weird.<br>
			  <br>
			  This feeling, it's not too dissimilar to that raw feeling of inspiration. 
			  Resonating with ambition, the ability to truly relax, the fun of doing absolutely nothing, enjoying the sun pour over the clouds as afternoon turns into evening. 
			  Today, I got on the bus as the pink clouds faded into the dead of night, cleansing the heat from the desert, allowing the vibrants lights of my town to breathe. 
			  That clear feeling of catching the bus with nobody on it, looking out the windows into pure black.
			  I had nothing to worry about, just dead air and time to waste, riding the bus home. 
			  There's still doubts of course, if I took the right lane, if I'm the true loser in all of this. 
			  Still, it didn't faze me today, not even a smidge.<br>
			  <br>
			  Complete assurance and the feeling that things will be just alright. 
			  I don't need to say it's obviously a pleasant feeling. 
			  More people would benefit from kicking back, relaxing, not thinking as hard. 
			  I know it's reductive to say, "just don't worry and you'll feel better", the whole "try to relax" paradox. 
			  I still think it's possible to take away the distractions, aside from what's mandatory, and soak in the atmosphere. 
			  Obviously in some sort of healthy manner, just be alone with the concrete around you so-to-say. 
			  Seek that for yourself.<br>
			  <br>
			  That's all for now, I just wanted to dump this little bit out somewhere.<br>
			  This one's very rambly and has no real substance, just kind of put some stuff out to get out.<br>
			  Take it easy then.<br>
