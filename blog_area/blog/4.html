              <td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" style="padding:5px"><span class="text4">I love going on the odd side of youtube or anything for that matter.<br />
              It is always fun to explore and find secrets and mysteries in media or games that you enjoy, even better when there is a story there to enrich that hunt.<br />
                <br /> 
                I used to be able to do this easily, with stuff like Youtube on the Wii and just older yotube in general it was easier to find odd stuff and leave your comfort zone.<br />
                <br />
                Good examples of this are stuff like:<br />
                <ul>
                <li>-Antichamber</li>
                <li>-Portal 1 & 2</li>
                <li>-ARGs</li>
                <li>-Old Source Creations</li>
                <li>-Gmod Animations</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                These were what I expierenced, yet I have had the worst time trying to rediscover them for a Playlist I have been creating.
                I wanted desperately to find the old videos from creators like: Ian Boswell, Eltorro64Rus, Graham Kartna and others that I found a while ago and found that "Odd Youtube" 
                expierence.<br />
                <br />
                If anything, these videos were an amazing expierence as you could find media and creations by individuals who had different tastes and ideas from you.<br />
                You could find odd videos made by people who had been in communities or events that were extremely out of your comfort zone but oh so interesting at the same time.<br />
                <br />
                To hammer this in, I give you "ye olde classic":<br />
				<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMc4Lcxmmso">MANDRILL MAZE</a></h2><br>
                <br />
                This national treasure holds this feeling I've been trying to describe perfectly.<br />
                I could go more into depth, but this has gotten a bit ridiculous so I'm gonna cut this short.
                If you want to find some of this stuff I have a secret playlist up for you to find, It isn't complete and theres still more to come so I'd suggest waiting on that hunt.<br />
