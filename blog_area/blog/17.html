              So let's get started.<br>
			  <h3>1. WELCOME TO THE INTERVIEW!</h3>
			  <br>
			  Hello bastards.. I am the man known as the "Big Bastard".<br>
			  Hear that? The big bastard. Remember it. Bastardly man...<br>
			  <br>
			  Apart from that, Howdy Fellas, I'm Max Konservsky, and I make games and other things for the peace of mind.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>2. How did you start making games and what inspired you initially?</h3>
			  <br>
			  I started making games back in 2013, when it came to me that there could be an easy way to make games.
			  So I looked it up and there were indeed programs that let you do that. The first program I landed on was Construct Classic, so I went with that.
			  I barely progressed over the next few years because tutorials used to invoke some kind of primal hatred within me, and since I didn't speak english I couldn't navigate the program well either.
			  But it was fun to mess around in it.<br>
			  <br>
			  The only inspiration I had back then were Jinxtengu's games, until it dawned on me in 2015 that I could try and create a space shooter, 
			  similar to the type of stuff i played when i was young, like Atomaders or Crusaders of Space.
			  I released about 3 games that year and not a single space shooter, but still it was fun.
			  I would usually work on something out of boredom during summer and then forget about the program for months.<br>
			  <br>
			  In 2016 when summer was about to come, I decided to revive some old projects but instead got inspired to make a brand new game inspired by some songs i listened to, and that's how Alien Invasion was born.
			  Shit, I remember it like yesterday, I really wish it was, good times. From this point on I realize that making games is real fun and I needed to do it full time.<br>
			  <br>
			  At this point I was still searching for the games I used to have on CDs when I was young, Shawn64 was a very inspiring figure at the time. 
			  I had only found out that he gave up the ghost 10 years after it had happened. Crazily enough the first time I played his games was a few months after he had already done it.
			  Still played Jinx's games at this time, although discovering Kubus rendered him obsolete for the rest of the adventure.<br>
			  <br>
			  I believe it was on a fateful evening of 29th (Or maybe 27th? I am looking at the calender right now and something seems off) of November 2016 that I ran into his games.<br>
			  Never been the same since then.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>3. For what reason do you keep reitterating the website and your games?<br>--What's your goal?</h3>
			  <br>
			  There is no goal, in fact. It is an endless cycle started off by me making the same mistakes over and over.
			  For some reason at the end of 2016 I felt like changing my alias and so I did, and for 2 weeks of the new year I made shorter, shittier games.
			  Until the 2 weeks came to an end and I nuked half of what was made and reverted all the changes.<br>
			  <br>
			  Then the same thing happened again (March - April), again (May - June) but this time I terminated everything completely at the end, then again (August - September), this time I went awol afterwards, coming back in late november I think.
			  Until Galaxa kicks off the whole thing all over, this time spanning 6 full months. If I had never decided to change the alias the whole cycle would have never kicked off, the website designs would never exist.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>4. What's your process for making games/art?<br>--How have you made so many?</h3>
			  <br>
			  This process can go in two ways, I either randomly come up with something that seems funny to me so I bring it to reality (Fuck Thermometer is the perfect example).
			  Sometimes I come up with a detailed game idea or story for a game and then make a game based on that. I've made so many because the bigger chunk of them was made with no effort in a few days or even less.
			  Not to say that I never made a good game in less than a week, but it is not something that should happen a lot.<br>
			  <br>
			  Additionally, especially during Galaxa, it was in a way a religious thing for me so i put out games like a conveyor belt. I do not recommend.
			  All of what I made fits into one single universe, there was a little information about that on Galaxa and as of right now I am preparing to put out full info on my current site.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>5. What's your best game in your opinion?<br>Also, what's your worst game?<br>Why are they the best/worst?</h3>
			  <br>
			  Can't do one, I think (this is where the list would be). They are the biggest games and the most fun to play.<br>
			  (Formatted in a list to make reading easier.)<br>
			  <ul>
			   <li>"Mr.Bean VS Scatman"</li>
               <li>"Bastards Fall Into The Void"</li>
			   <li>"Dad's Driving License"</li>
			   <li>"Rum IV"</li>
			   <li>"Rum VI: 5 Bottles of Rum"</li>
			  </ul>
			  <br>
			  Almost the entirety of my catalogue from 2017 and 2018 is godawful and many games can't even be called that.
			  So the worst thing i made that I CAN call a game would be "Christmas Massacre".
			  It took the longest time to make, 2 months, and came out boring and very generic.
			  I hated it from day 1 and immediately went in a different direction after making it. But I guess it was good learning experience.<br>
			  <br>
			  Here's a tip: If a game takes a long time to make, you are doing something wrong.
			  Put the pedal to the metal with your eyes on the road and your hands on the wheel and put it out fast instead.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>6. What are your favorite games of all-time?</h3>
			  <br>
			  All time from the dawn of man???
			  I played Doom 3, Quake 1, 4 and Wolfenstein 3D into oblivion.
			  Deus Ex and both System Shock games, first two Fallout games are great too. Borderlands.
			  Both hotline miami games are great.<br>
