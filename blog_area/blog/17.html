			  Right, let's go.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>1. WELCOME TO THE INTERVIEW!</h3>
			  <br>
			  numba one rule of life,<br>
			  dont be a bastardo<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>2. What did you do before making games?<br>
			  What exactly brought you into making things in the first place?<br>
			  (Pre-Sally, essentially.)</h3>
			  <br>
			  I have always wanted to make games since I was young really. 
			  I always imagined the games I'd make and how they would be endless shooters with infinite weapon upgrades with endless levels n' shit.<br>
			  <br>
			  When I was about 8 or 9 I moved schools, one day at this new school we went to the nearby highschool to try to get used to the highschool environment.
			  One of the things we did was Scratch, and I enjoyed this so much that I started making them at home. 
			  Now unfortunately most of these are lost, but there is still one of my old scratch accounts up on the internet.<br>
			  <br>
			  Feel free to play them here:<br>
			  <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/users/reuben641000/">RustyMoon's Old Scratch Page</a><br>
			  <br>
			  But then, when it really got started is when I met my ex-best friend in highschool who was a big fnaf fan and was making fangames.
			  Of course I was interested in how he made them, it turns out he was using a program called Clickteam Fusion 2.5.
			  With this knowledge I began my "Real" game making journey, although I never really finished anything.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>3. What exactly got you into making games?</h3>
			  <br>
			  I dont actually know really. 
			  I find it hard to enjoy somthing without wanting to do it myself. 
			  I've allways wanted to make games since I was young, but stuff like "Mario Forever" I played when I was like 6.
			  It was allways really cool to me that someone could just create their own mario game for the fun of others.<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>4. Unlike most other Sunfish-based creators, your games lean the most on Kubus' design.<br>
			  What in specific makes you enjoy that style of work?<br>
			  Do you think you're faithful to that "branding"?</h3>
			  <br>
			  It feels honest, it feels like when you draw a picture but dont change any of it. 
			  It feels to me like there is a story to be told. It feels like its completly random, but at the same time really very cohesive.
			  It also has me trying to guess what the intention behind the drawings are.<br>
			  <br>
			  For example: there is one game where a dude is on a magic carpet, 
			  but it also looks like he has his legs streight forward and back. 
			  Who knows what the intention was?<br>
			  <br>
			  Am I faithful to the style? 
			  Yeah I think so, making games in that style provides a sense of relief as I don't have to give a shit how stuff looks, haha. 
			  (It also makes the art quicker to draw.)<br>
			  <br>
			  <h3>5. What's game most adheres to *your* own unique "style", do you think it's good?<br>
			  What game is the least "your style", do you think it's good?</h3>
