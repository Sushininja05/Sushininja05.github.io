              <td colspan="2" align="left" valign="top" style="padding:5px"><span class="text4">Creating a project can be both fufilling and important to people.<br />
              Simply creating something impressive could land you a job or even set you for life! There are lots of examples of it.
              But what happens when you finish what you are working on? A lot of people neglect to mention that ever, especially if that fails.<br />
              <br />
              There are many ways your project can go after you've completed it, most of the time it won't be pretty. Here are some:<br />
              <br />
                <ul>
                <li>-Praise, Improvement, Review, and Good Attention.<br />
                    Defintely the high route out of all of these options, in most cases if you put in the work and put care, love, and passion into something
                    then it'll turn out this way.</li>
                    <br />
                <li>-Hatred, Decline, and Bad Attention.<br />
                    This is the low route for most of these, it usually comes from not nurturing your project and forcing it out before you could give it the care
                    it deserves.</li>
                    <br />
                <li>-Improvement, Neglect, and Personal Goals.<br />
                    You've created your project and nobody is around to see, better luck next time stranger. You could either keep going and personally improve or
                    run out of motivation so bad that you stop, sometimes all you need for motivation is somebody to enjoy what you play even a little bit.</li>
                </ul>
                <br />
                <br />
                These are prime examples of the aftermath of game developement.<br />
                <br />
                It's always a sad moment when your project or a project by a developer you know just doesn't get the attention it deserves.
                It is hard to break even when new games are flying at you every single day at a constant rate that is impossible to keep up with.
                So what do you do?<br />
                <br />
                Stand out of the crowd, put yourself out there and make your work different as well as inspiring.
                The idea could be as simple as making the art style completely different or as jurassic as making a game that focuses on complexitiy and touts it around.
                Games are simple, it is what you do with them that will determine your success.<br />
                <br />
                Heres an example:<br />
                So I'm gonna go over 2 games and we're gonna see which one is more "exciting to you" based on how they are sold to you, let's go.<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                Example #1:<br />
                Name: Dubble Dutch Fighters<br />
                Tagline: A game about fighting other people so hard they explode.<br />
                <br/>
                Description: A fighting game with 8 characters that has a never before seen mechanic that forces you to play more strategically.
                Every player takes damage and deals damage all the same, but nobody can ever die without landing a specific move.
                Each character has a different set of moves that end with explosions, these moves must be charged and must have the correct meter for them.
                However these moves do insane damage and can only be performed on Parry, Block, or Guard Cancel.
                These moves have different properties just like any other move and can inflict effects that do an array of things.
                <br />
                The game has online support, features local play, and includes an array of fun to be had.
                We'd love for you to join us, downloadable forever.<br />
                <br />
                <br />
                Example #2:<br />
                Name: Really Awesome Cool Game The Sequel<br/>
                Tagline: Awesome game I made in Game Maker over my summer break.<br />
                <br/>
                Description: 20 awesome levels of good fun with a difficult game to boot
                theres a great story mode and awesome campaign for you to play
                hope to see you playing it<br/>
                cheers<br/>
                <br/>
                <br />
                <br />
                <br />
                I know those examples seem a little bit too Black & White, but you would want to play Example #1 right?
                Of course you would, because the other one is under developed and isn't descriptive enough.
                Everyone is fighting for your attention and giving it to them and enticing them is the overall goal.
                <br />
                Hopefully this helped, originally the scope of this post was supposed to be way bigger but I put it on the backburner too long and decided I had to just finish it off.
