<h1><strong>The Funzone Roadmap!!!</strong></h1>
<br>
<a href="https://durdgeo.neocities.org/">I actually don't care.</a>
<br>
<br>
<p>So this is taking forever, I've also lost a chunk of the funzone due to some shitty flashdrives.</p>
<p>So I'm gonna throw together a roadmap and update it whenever I make progress, so we can be on a more even level.</p>
<br>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>I'm being real lazy, I should be able to finish this in a few days.
<br>
<br>

<h2><strong>Part 1: Where Are We? [1/2]</strong></h2>
<p>+Menu Land</p>
<p>-There will be 4 sections that we need to be completed.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Side Areas: [IN PROGRESS]</li>
<li>HTML Games w/comments(HTML Versions of my games on the website and other games, including... : POGO, S, MMAY, DOG2B, HL, KD, BJ, W3D = https://github.com/id-Software/wolf3d-browser . < -- all acronyms)</li>
<li>Reviews & Dev Logs. ARTICLES.(unrelated to blog entries and will most likely be very long opinonated write-ups about shit)</li>
<li>Stuff I've Done + Misc Creations (Tf2 Mods, Tutorials, Ticket Speedruns, Grandman Custom Maps.)</li>
<br>
<li>Main Area: [X]</li>
<li>We're done here! The side areas are in developement, I'm being lazy sorry.
</ul>

<br>
<br>

<h2><strong>Part 2: FUckK OfFf [0/3]</strong></h2>
<p>+Contentos</p>
<p>-Shifting loads of things to the new fun zone.
<br>
<ul>
<li>Games: [IN PROGRESS]</li>
<li>Converting my games to HTML with the help of Moony Rust and adding comments per game and using a similar system to blog to swap between games.</li>
<br>
<li>Articles: [IN PROGRESS]</li>
<li>Reviews & Dev Logs(create reviews, I already have some in mind, and add dev logs or stuff like change logs, fix log, whatever.)</li>
<br>
<li>Stuff I've Done + Misc Creations: [IN PROGRESS]</li>
<li>Putting up downloads for TF2 Mods that I still have, Tutorials, Ticket Speedrun Stuff, & whatever else.</li>
<li>This part should be easy to complete considering I already have a lot of this stuff compilied.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>

<h3><strong>Part 3: The Final Destination [?/?]</strong></h3>
<p>This part will be nothing but visual polish, bug fixing, art additions, and other dumb stuff I'd add.</p>
<p>It'll be the most enjoyable to see from an outsider's perspective and you'll probably enjoy it I'd bet.</p>
<p>After I complete all of it, I will test it all and change the funzone link and push it out to the world.</p>
