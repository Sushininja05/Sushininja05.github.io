<h1><strong>The Funzone Roadmap!!!</strong></h1>
<br>
<a href="https://sushininja05.github.io/">I actually don't care.</a>
<br>
<br>
<p>So this is taking forever, I've also lost a chunk of the funzone due to some shitty flashdrives.</p>
<p>So I'm gonna throw together a roadmap and update it whenever I make progress, so we can be on a more even level.</p>
<br>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>I'm being real lazy, I should be able to finish this in a few days.</p>
<p>(LATER EDIT: OK YEAH I AM EXTREME LAZY, COMPLETEING THIS IN 2 DAYS WHICH INCLUDES TODAY. 1/1/19)
<br>
<br>

<h2><strong>Part 1: Where Are We? [2/2]</strong></h2>
<p>+Menu Land</p>
<p>-There will be 3 sections that we need to be completed.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Side Areas: [X]</li>
<li>HTML Games w/comments(HTML Versions of my games on the website and other games, including... : POGO, S, MMAY, DOG2B, HL, BJ.</li>
<li>Reviews & Dev Logs. ARTICLES.(unrelated to blog entries and will most likely be very long opinonated write-ups about shit)</li>
<li>Stuff I've Done + Misc Creations (Tf2 Mods, Tutorials, Ticket Speedruns, Grandman Custom Maps.)</li>
<br>
<li>Main Area: [X]</li>
<li>We're done here!
</ul>

<br>
<br>

<h2><strong>Part 2: the MEAT [0/2]</strong></h2>
<p>+Contentos</p>
<p>-Shifting loads of things to the new fun zone.
<br>
<ul>
<li>Games: [IN PROGRESS]</li>
<li>Converting my games to HTML with the help of Moony Rust and adding comments per game and using a similar system to blog to swap between games.</li>
<br>
<li>Stuff I've Done + Misc Creations: [IN PROGRESS]</li>
<li>Putting up downloads for TF2 Mods that I still have, Tutorials, Ticket Speedrun Stuff, & whatever else.</li>
<li>This part should be easy to complete considering I already have a lot of this stuff compilied.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<br>

<h2><strong>Part 3: The Final Destination [7/?]</strong></h2>
<p>This part will be nothing but visual polish, bug fixing, art additions, and other dumb stuff I'd add.</p>
<p>I've nearly completed all of the visual polish! The only thing left (polish-wise) is game buttons.</p>
