Welcome to my website! 
Originally just on Neocities, I decided to move it after due to it's annoying upload refresh and "update" log.
I also just wanted my files to be transparent so other people could reference my shitty HTML.

I started this as a project out of boredom, ended up morphing into my main hub for all my work.
I've taken to keeping it with the hopes that it inspires others to try and make their own sites.
Keep in mind that a lot of my work is from other html examples, this is just a personal website that shows those examples in use.

Thanks,
Durdge-o
