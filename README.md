Welcome to my website, this was originally hosted on neocities but I decided to move it after some complications.
This exists just to inspire others to try and make their own sites.
Please use my pages as a refrence, don't straight up steal or misuse any of my stuff.
Keep in mind that a lot of my work is from other html examples, this is just a personal website that shows those examples in use.

Good luck with your endeavours, hopefully this is interesting or helps you out.
