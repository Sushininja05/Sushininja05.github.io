<h1><strong>Aye. Here's all the negative feedback for yer game:</strong></h1>
    

<p>
Played a bit more of your game
and here's some feedback:</p>
<br>
<p>-Wall Bouncing while useful should be forced to when you hold space bar, allowing you to have a bit more control over it and jump around close objects with more precision.</p>
<br>
<p>-Wall Bouncing shouldn't apply fall-damage. In levels like the city you can get stuck between two walls and bounce like hell, forcing you to take a death (which sucks).</p>
<p>Let's say if you were to BHOP really well or abuse it a lot (like I do) you can hit walls and it will deal fall-damage even though you are using it to break a fall or rebound around.<br>
<br>
It's pretty nasty, it's especially easy to do it in the tutorial.</p>
<br>
<p>-Using speed or being speedy results in dying, probably because you assigned fall damage to the speed value.
It's really really really bad in some places, especially the slopey stairs near the beginning of City, where you are melted by 
fall damage unless you stop near the top of every "stair".</p>
<br>
<p>It sucks, especially if you are going for a good time, it's boring and limits those who like to abuse BHOP.
It ruins the whole time trial part of the game.</p>
<br>
<p>-Time Trials & Checkpoint system is really gross!<br>
Like stated before, being fast is a detriment due to agressive fall damage and food collection being bad if you are going to be fast.
Checkpoints however completely negate the whole Time Trial system, removing the need for those mechanics entirely anyways.
The main culprit is being able to set checkpoints while dead, allowing you to eat a fall and set a checkpoint.
Also pressing 0 doesn't reset time.<br>
<br>
If I were to fix it I'd force these requirements:<br>
<li>Land is directly under the player.</li>
 
<li>
Player is touching land.</li>
 
<li>
Player is stopped or at walking speed.</li>
 
<li>
Player is alive.</li>
 
<br>
(It'd be cool if food played more into it, requiring you to have food to save a checkpoint. Using food in the process, but checkpoints
restore your health.)</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>There should be some vids here sooner or later (uploading them now 1/9/18 6:34 pm) to illustrate some of my points:</p>
